Selfies are all soft and smudgy however the back camera is superb. Then the fingerprint scanner, that's a different story all together. Started to fail every single time after 2days of purchasing. Dual sim Never works as when both sim cards are at play, this phone struggles real hard to provide you network. Overall a very avarage phone, and surely overpriced. This phone should have costed 22k max.... "
